                value_template: "{{ trigger.event.data.message == '!status' }}"
            sequence:
              - service: hairc.send_message
                data:
                  message: >
                    Status:

                value_template: "{{ trigger.event.data.message == '!help' }}"
            sequence:
              - service: hairc.send_message
                data:

```

## Events

The integration sends the following events that can be used in automations:

### `hairc_message`
Triggered when a message is received in the IRC channel.

Event data:
- `message`: The message text
- `sender`: The sender's nick
- `channel`: The channel the message came from
- `type`: "public" or "private"

### `hairc_connected`
Triggered when the bot connects to the IRC server.

### `hairc_disconnected`
Triggered when the bot disconnects from the IRC server.

## Services

### `hairc.send_message`
Sends a message to an IRC channel.

```yaml
service: hairc.send_message
data:
  message: "Hello from Home Assistant!"
  channel: "#mychannel"  # Optional
```

## Sensor Attributes

The IRC sensor has the following attributes:

- `messages`: The last 10 messages received in the channel
- `connected`: Connection status (true/false)

## Troubleshooting

If you experience connection issues:

1. Verify the server address and port are correct
2. Try with `ssl: false` if you have SSL issues
3. Enable debug logging for the integration:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.hairc: debug
```
